# Project Title: Rainydays

This project was my first experience using **Figma**, **HTML**, and **CSS** to bring a design to life. The goal of this assignment was to create a fully functional and responsive website based on a design brief from my Design 1 course.

## Features
- Responsive layout using **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**.
- Accessible design that follows **WCAG standards**.
- Semantic HTML structure to ensure readability and SEO optimization.
- Browser compatibility across major platforms.
- Includes custom **meta descriptions**, **titles**, and **h1** elements for each page.

## Learning Experience
In this project, I learned to:
- Translate a static design from Figma into functional HTML and CSS.
- Structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements.
- Ensure my site is responsive and accessible on different devices and screen sizes.
- Test and validate my code using developer tools and accessibility tools like WAVE.

## Technologies Used
- **Figma** for design prototyping.
- **HTML5** for building the structure of the website.
- **CSS3** for styling and layout.
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting the live site.
